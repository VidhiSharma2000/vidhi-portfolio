## Hello, I’m Vidhi!

I'm a passionate analytics student at Boston University with a love for problem-solving, strategy, and turning data into real-world impact. I’ve worked on everything from automating dashboards at TransUnion to exploring employment trends and consumer behavior in my personal projects.

I'm currently pursuing my MS in Applied Business Analytics and looking for opportunities to create meaningful change through data-driven innovation.
