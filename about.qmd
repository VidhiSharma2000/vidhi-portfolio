## Professional Profile

Hello! I'm Vidhi, a passionate analytics student currently pursuing my Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. With a background in Computer Science and professional experience as a Business Analyst, I'm developing advanced skills to tackle complex problems through technology and analytics.

My journey in data started during my undergraduate studies, where I discovered the power of transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Since then, I've been on a mission to leverage data-driven approaches to solve real-world challenges and enable better business decisions.
