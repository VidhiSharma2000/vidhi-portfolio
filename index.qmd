# About Me {#about}

Hi, I'm Vidhi Sharma, currently pursuing my Master’s in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. With a background in Computer Science and hands-on experience in analytics, operations, and business strategy, I specialize in turning messy data into crystal-clear action.

I’ve worked across a range of industries and tools, from streamlining backend workflows to building dashboards for non-technical decision makers. I love blending structured logic with creative clarity, and my superpower is making technical insights easy to understand and even easier to act on.

# How I Help Companies {#how-i-help}

I help companies turn scattered, messy data into smart, actionable decisions. Whether it’s through building predictive models, streamlining ETL pipelines, or creating clean, intuitive dashboards, my focus is always on solving real problems with real impact.

At the same time, I believe good analytics shouldn’t be intimidating. My job is to make data useful to marketing teams, operations managers, and executives who need clarity, not complexity.
