# About Me

Hi, I'm **Vidhi Sharma**, currently pursuing my Master’s in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. With a background in Computer Science and hands-on experience in analytics, operations, and business strategy, I specialize in turning messy data into crystal-clear action.

I’ve worked across a range of industries and tools, from streamlining backend workflows to building dashboards for non-technical decision-makers. My superpower is blending logic with creative clarity — turning technical insights into strategic action.

# Projects

### New York Real Estate Analysis
<div class="project">
**Problem:** The NYC housing market is notoriously complex, and understanding price drivers is critical for buyers, sellers, and investors.  
**What I Did:** I led a detailed time series and regression-based analysis on historical sales data to identify key pricing predictors like location, square footage, and listing duration. I also explored seasonal demand trends and outlier behavior in luxury segments for an academic project.  
**Expanded Insight:** This project helped visualize how even small variations in square footage or neighborhood can drastically affect price bands. I also experimented with model tuning to improve prediction accuracy and detect over/underpriced listings.
</div>

### Skincare Sales Data Analysis
<div class="project">
**Problem:** A retail beauty brand wanted to understand how pricing, promotion, and seasonality affected product sales across categories.  
**What I Did:** I initiated this project independently to explore real-world sales behavior. I cleaned and analyzed transactional data to evaluate discount sensitivity, product bundling impact, and brand loyalty. Currently working on a dashboard to visualize the findings.  
**Expanded Insight:** I used visual exploration and statistical summaries to identify demand spikes during promotional windows and detect high-performing bundles. Insights are being translated into visual dashboards to support sales and product teams.
</div>

### Stickley Adhesives Operations Optimization
<div class="project">
**Problem:** A simulated manufacturing company was facing high material waste and long production cycles.  
**What I Did:** I conducted process mapping and bottleneck analysis using tools from Lean methodology. I identified inefficiencies in material handling and production flow. I simulated new workflows that included better scheduling and resource allocation for an academic project.  
**Expanded Insight:** Proposed actionable changes that could reduce material waste by ~10% and lead times by 12%. Developed a report highlighting the ROI of each proposed improvement, focusing on cost-effective operational change and implementation feasibility.
</div>

### AI vs Non-AI Job Growth Dashboard
<div class="project">
**Problem:** Companies and job seekers are struggling to understand how AI is reshaping the labor market.  
**What I Did:** I scraped and analyzed job posting data across multiple industries to compare demand, salary trends, and skill requirements for AI-related roles vs traditional ones as a part of an academic project.  
**Expanded Insight:** Currently developing a dashboard hosted on AWS that visualizes the rise of AI jobs by sector, average pay differences, and essential skill sets. This tool is designed to help HR professionals and students plan their hiring and learning strategies more effectively.
